**Manifest URL**: https://github.com/justinthejaguar/Planar-Compass-Classes/releases/latest/download/module.json

This is a Foundry VTT compendium which incorporates the Planar Compass Class Options created by the folks at [Planar Compass](https://www.planarcompass.com/) for play with OSR games, and specifically made for Old-School Essentials. The module was created for the  [Old-School Essentials System](https://foundryvtt.com/packages/ose) on Foundry VTT. If you like what you see, make sure to grab the Planar Compass Zines ASAP for adventures and Planar Ship Rules.

**Classes Included:**
Aldhelsi, Astral Sailor, Chanicoid, Onauk, Psion, and Time Priest

**Abilities Included:**
Sailor Abilities, Time Priest Spells, as well as Psionic Powers!

Each class has its own abilities and journal entry for progression contained.
